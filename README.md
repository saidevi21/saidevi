Rice Type Identification AI Model

Project Title

GrainPalette: A Deep Learning-Based Rice Type Identification Model Project Overview

The Rice Type Identification AI model provides an innovative solution for farmers, agricultural scientists, and gardening enthusiasts to accurately identify various types of rice grains through image analysis. By leveraging cutting-edge computer vision and deep learning techniques, this tool delivers rapid, reliable predictions, empowering users to make informed decisions on cultivation, research, and education.

Objective

To design and implement an AI model capable of classifying up to five types of rice grains using image data.
To provide a user-friendly interface that allows stakeholders to upload rice grain images and receive instant predictions.
To support sustainable and informed agricultural practices.
Methodology

Data Collection & Preparation: Curated a dataset containing images of five rice types. Images were resized and augmented to improve model generalization.
Model Architecture: Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with transfer learning from MobileNetv4, fine-tuned on the rice dataset for optimal performance.
Training & Validation: Trained the model on annotated images using cross-entropy loss and evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrices.
Deployment: Integrated the trained model into a web-based application with a simple image upload interface for real-time predictions.
